The code has been split across multiple files depending on the algorithm used. The random forests algorithm has been split into three separate files depending on the model (RF2, RF3, RF4). Both the fitting of the algorithm and the model 
reduction is contained in each random forest file.
All packages used are loaded in the code. 
All KNN and random forest results were immediate. The ANN code took 1-2 hours on a desktop computer.
